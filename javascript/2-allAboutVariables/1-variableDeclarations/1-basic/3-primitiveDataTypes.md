1. Numbers: The number data type represents numeric values. It includes integers and floating-point numbers.

```javascript
let age = 25;
let pi = 3.14;
```

2. Strings: The string data type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double
   quotes ("").

```javascript
let name = "John";
let message = 'Hello, world!';
```

3. Booleans: The boolean data type represents logical values, either `true` or `false`.

```javascript
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;
```

4. Null: The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value.

```javascript
let myVariable = null;
```

5. Undefined: The undefined data type represents variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value.

```javascript
let myVariable;
let anotherVariable = undefined;
```

To declare a variable and assign a value, you can use the `let` keyword followed by the variable name and the assignment
operator (`=`) to assign a value to the variable.

For example:

```javascript
let age = 25; // Declare 'age' variable and assign a number value
let name = "John"; // Declare 'name' variable and assign a string value
let isTrue = true; // Declare 'isTrue' variable and assign a boolean value
let myVariable = null; // Declare 'myVariable' variable and assign a null value
let myUndefinedVariable; // Declare 'myUndefinedVariable' variable (assigned undefined by default)
```

It's important to note that JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you can change the value and type of
variable later in the code.

These are the basic primitive data types in JavaScript, and understanding how to declare variables and assign values of
these types will give you a solid foundation for working with data in JavaScript.
