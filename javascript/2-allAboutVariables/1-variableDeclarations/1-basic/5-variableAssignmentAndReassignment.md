Variable scoping and closures are fundamental concepts in JavaScript. Let's delve deeper into each of them:

1. Scoping:
    - Scoping refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables in different parts of your code. It defines where a
      variable can be accessed and where it is not accessible.
    - In JavaScript, there are two types of scopes: global scope and local scope (also known as function scope or block
      scope).
    - Global scope: Variables declared outside any function or block have global scope. They are accessible
      throughout the entire program.
    - Local scope: Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope. They are only accessible within the
      specific function or block where they are declared.
    - JavaScript uses lexical scoping, which means that variables are resolved based on their position in the source
      code.

2. Closures:
    - A closure is a function that remembers and has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after
      that scope has finished executing.
    - Closures are created when a nested function accesses variables from its outer function.
    - The inner function maintains a reference to its outer variables, allowing it to access and use those variables
      even when the outer function has returned or finished executing.
    - Closures are powerful because they enable data encapsulation and create private variables in JavaScript.

Here's an example to illustrate closures:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I'm from the outer function";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing the outer variable
    }

    return innerFunction; // Returning the inner function
}

let closure = outerFunction(); // Assigning the returned inner function to a variable
closure(); // Invoking the closure, which logs "I'm from the outer function"
```

In the above example, `innerFunction` is defined inside `outerFunction`. It has access to the `outerVariable` declared
in its outer scope, even after `outerFunction` has finished executing. This behavior is due to closures.

Closures have various use cases, including:

- Implementing data privacy by creating private variables inaccessible from outside the closure.
- Creating functions with persistent state, as the variables in the outer scope are retained.
- Managing asynchronous operations by preserving the state of variables across different function calls.

Understanding scoping and closures is essential for writing effective and maintainable JavaScript code. By leveraging
closures, you can create more flexible and powerful functions that maintain access to relevant variables beyond their
immediate scope.
