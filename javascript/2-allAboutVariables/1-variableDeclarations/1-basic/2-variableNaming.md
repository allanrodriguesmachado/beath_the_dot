## Variable Declarations

#### en-US

1. Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). They cannot start with a digit (0-9).
2. After the initial character, variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
3. Variable names are case-sensitive, so `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered different variables.
4. Avoid using reserved keywords (e.g., `let`, `const`, `if`, `for`, etc.) as variable names.

Now, let's discuss the naming conventions commonly used in JavaScript:

1. Camel Case: In camel case, the first letter of the variable name is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. For example:
   ```javascript
   let myVariableName = "camel case";
   let totalItemCount = 10;
   ```

2. Snake Case: In snake case, words are separated by underscores, and all letters are lowercase. For example:
   ```javascript
   let my_variable_name = "snake case";
   let total_item_count = 10;
   ```

It's important to choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables to enhance code readability. Here are some additional best practices to consider when naming variables:

- Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose or meaning of the variable.
- Avoid using single-letter names, except for loop counters or well-known conventions (e.g., `i`, `j`).
- Be consistent with your naming style throughout your codebase.
- Use lowercase for variable names and reserve uppercase for constants or constructor functions.

Here are some examples showcasing the rules and naming conventions:

#### Basic Examples:

```javascript
// Valid variable names
let age = 25;
let _privateVariable = true;
let firstName = "John";

// Invalid variable names
let 123abc; // Cannot start with a digit
let let = true; // Reserved keyword
let first-name; // Hyphens are not allowed

// Camel Case
let myVariableName = "camel case";
let totalItemCount = 10;

// Snake Case
let my_variable_name = "snake case";
let total_item_count = 10;
```

By following these rules and conventions, you'll create more maintainable and understandable code.
